## General info

**AniManager** is a package to help in the tedious job of keeping track of the animals used for research.

*More content soon!*

## Installation
This project is written in python and has the following dependencies:
* `python >= 3.7`
* `numpy  == 1.18.1`
* `pandas == 1.0.1`

1. [Download and Install Anaconda individual Edition](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). This will install the Jupyter Notebook that will be necessary for running the python scrips.

2. [Download the ani_manager from github](https://github.com/joseferncruz/ani_manager/archive/master.zip). Unzip this file and save it your local machine. For those familiar with git, you can simply use:
 `git clone https://github.com/joseferncruz/ani_manager.git`
 If you want to learn more about git and github, I recommend the software carpentry course: [Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/).

3. Launch Anaconda Navigator and then Jupyter Notebook. Then, go to the directory that was download in step 2.

4. Launch the `example_manage_animal_records.ipynb` file that is in the directory `notebooks`. New to jupyter notebooks? No problem. You can have a look at the (vast) online tutorias, for example: [Jupyter Notebook for Beginners: A Tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/).

## Web Browser Compatibility

This project was tested using the Firefox Browser (version 74.0 (64-bit)).

## Python resources

If you have limited knowledge in python, I recommend the following free learning material:
* [Using Python for Research](https://www.edx.org/course/using-python-for-research) from HarvardX on edX.
* [Programming with Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) from software carpentry.
* [Scipy Lecture Notes](https://scipy-lectures.org/).
